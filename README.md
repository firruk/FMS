# Financial Management Mobile application for college students

This is an final year honors project developed using flutter in android studio.


College students confront various problems and develop many skills that will help them in their college adventure
and future, but one of the most important skills students need is to handle their funds properly. According to
Iotuition, over half of students say they do not understand or practice money management. The project's goal is
to create a personal finance mobile application for college students in Oman that would assist them in managing
their money and provide insights into them. The application collects the student's expenditure information. It
provides customers with insight into their spending habits, assists them in saving money, reduces the likelihood
of overspending, and assists them in managing their expenses and debts. Using machine learning, the program
estimates how much money will be saved and spent in the coming month. The predictive machine learning
algorithms proposed by earlier authors for financial planning are used to examine the many financial
management techniques and tools necessary to improve financial management in general and for college
students. In addition, there is a debate on how the user interface should be designed. The article describes the
application design and technologies needed to create the application, as well as an example prototype. The
introduction, research, and pre-design of the proposed application are contained in the paper, which will
subsequently be produced in the technical phase utilizing the resources and information contained in the paper.
